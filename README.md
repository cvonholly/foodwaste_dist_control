# distributed network of foodwaste relevant actors

this project is made in context of the lecture [Advanced Topics in Control](https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?semkez=2024S&ansicht=ALLE&lerneinheitId=178230&lang=de)

Our idea is to model the system as a distributed network with inflows and outflows (both representing food flow). Each subsystem in the network represents an actor in the food waste cycle. For example, a consumer subsystem consists of a state x representing stored/bought quantities of food and an output of consumption and food waste.
