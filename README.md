This repo is for a project in the subject Advanced Topics in Control.

Our idea is to model the system as a distributed network with inflows and outflows (both representing food flow). Each subsystem in the network represents an actor in the food waste cycle. For example, a consumer subsystem consists of a state x representing stored/bought quantities of food and an output of consumption and food waste.
